 <h1>Ashleigh McLean</h1>
 <p>Hey, I’m Ashleigh McLean! I’m passionate about technology, problem-solving, and cybersecurity, but beyond the code, I love connecting with people and bringing ideas to life. Whether it’s tackling a tough project, managing PR for an event, or just creating fun content, I put my heart into everything I do. I have a curious mind, always eager to learn and explore new things, and I love a good challenge. Outside of tech, you’ll probably find me keeping up with social media trends, supporting my sorority sisters, or just enjoying a good solo adventure!</p>
